Hey y'all, I am Yannick. I live at the end of the world in Finistère, France.
We live a simple life there and I work remotely, making developers' life easier over 4G+.
We moved from a city in Belgium to reconnect with nature.  

I try to be a kind, genuine and fun person.  
I **care about our planet 🌍** and try to live making no harm.  
I value honesty and transparency in relationships.  
I will be true to those values and won't wear a mask anywhere.  
I value **simplicity** and **minimalism**, both in life and software.

👋🏻
