I had the crazy idea to subscribe to Department of Brewology [Sequence No. 3](https://departmentofbrewology.com/collections/roaster-collaboration-series-boxset).
A 6 months subscription with many other things than coffee.
I received the first one late in January. The attention to detail in that box was surprising.

There is of course the beans, from [the Barn](https://thebarn.de). But also, [coffee blossom honey](https://www.coffeeblossomhoney.com), [third wave water](https://thirdwavewater.com), an amazing print and more.

I was definitively crazy to get this subscription, but I do not regret it at all.
