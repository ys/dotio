- I had some alone time with Tom today and we had much fun doing simple games and reading. It was a nice moment shared with him.
- We went to Brittany to visit houses and it felt great, we are still unsure about one. We need to check location and if tourism is good around there but it feels like we are moving to the goal we have.
- I have finally called the driving school and will have lessons in march, also having dentist appointments in march. Those two were the major things I wanted to fix this year, and I did it. I am pretty proud of myself.
