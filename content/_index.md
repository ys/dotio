I am a **product and customer driven developer**. Currently building Private spaces at Heroku, a salesforce company.

Iâ€™ve been building the Developer Experience, internal tooling, continuous delivery, chatops and compliance tooling for heroku. Previously, I was driving back-end development for startups or building products for clients.

I truly believe that **software serves the people** and not the opposite.

**Make it simple**, not clever.

Want to talk about simplicity, product or remote culture? ping me. I also enjoy a good cup of coffee.
