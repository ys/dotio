## ðŸ’» Hello,

I am a product and customer driven developer. Currently building the Developer Experience at Heroku, a salesforce company.

Iâ€™ve been an internal tooling developer, building continuous delivery, chatops and compliance tooling for heroku. Previously, I was driving back-end development for startups or building products for clients.

I truly believe that software serves the people and not the opposite. Make it simple, not clever.

Want to talk about simplicity, product or remote culture? ping me. I also enjoy a good cup of coffee.
