I am a software developper driven by **product and customer**. I love solving **real people issues**.

Currently building Private spaces at [Heroku](https://heroku.com), a salesforce company.

I built pieces of the Developer Experience, internal tooling, continuous delivery, chatops and compliance tooling for Heroku. Previously, I was driving back-end development for startups or building products for clients.

**Make it simple**, we are all dumb most of the time.

Want to talk about simplicity, product or remote culture? ping me. I also enjoy a good cup of coffee.
